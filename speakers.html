She has also overseen the universal design construction of her new home.

Julie is also one of the first in Ontario to be a Certified Rick Hansen Foundation Accessibility Certification Professional. She has started her own business, Sawchuk Accessible Solutions, helping companies large and small learn how easy access can be.</p>
