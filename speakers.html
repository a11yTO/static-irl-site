  <div class="speaker-bio">
    <p>Kendra (she/her) has a Master of Landscape Architecture degree from the University of Guelph (2019), and is in her first year of supervised practice for Baker Turner Inc. as a Landscape Architectural Intern and Certified Arborist (ISA).</p>
    <p>Kendra is experienced in community engaged research, and brings a disability and climate justice lens to her work in design advocacy and private practice. For her Master's thesis, she wrote about the experience of the built environment at the neighbourhood scale as a person with a form of dysautonomia, an autonomic nervous system disorder that is impacted by sudden weather changes, including: temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure fluctuations. These weather conditions can impact what are called 'microclimates', where on a smaller scale, form such as vegetation or built structures impact the feelings of cold or warmth to a person, often impacting a person's mobility when conditions become extreme. From her research, she created a preliminary 'go-along' interview, where a person can walk or roll through their neighbourhood and audit the built environment as it relates to their needs during different weather events, highlighting the importance of microclimate design as it relates to accessibility.</p>
