<h1>The Event</h1>
<p>Join us Thursday October 22nd at 6pm for 2020’s <strong>#a11yIRL</strong> event!</p>
<p>Sarah Manteuffel will be back this year to host speakers from different fields impacting built environment accessibility. We’ll start off with short talks followed by questions in an informal panel structure. <a href="/speakers">More about our speakers, here</a>.</p>
<p>As part of this event we’ll also be gathering ways you can learn more about built environment accessibility – things to read, listen to, or watch – and sharing the collection with attendees afterwards. These recommendations will come from the speakers, the event team, and you – the attendees!</p>
<p>So gather your questions, your favourite articles, podcasts and book recommendations and more, and join us when Accessibility in Real Life goes digital.</p>
<p>This event is free and live captions and ASL will be provided!</p>
