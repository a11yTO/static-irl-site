        <h2>The Event</h2>
        <p>#a11yTO is excited to announce our first #a11yIRL, or Accessibility in Real Life, Conference, a one day event focused specifically on the built environment.</p>
        <p>Borrowing from #a11yTOConf's great "playlist" format of lectures, demos and lightening talks, we're bringing together experts and those new to the field to talk about inclusive design, universal design, and all things accessibility in real life.</p>
        <p>Mark October 26, 2019 on your calendar as the day to build your knowledge, build your network, and join a community of people building Accessibility In Real Life.</p>
