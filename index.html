<h2>Thank you!</h2>
<p>On Thursday October 22nd Sarah Manteuffel returned this year to host speakers from different fields impacting built environment accessibility. We started off with short talks followed by questions in an informal panel structure.</p>
<p>As part of this event we also gathered ways to learn more about built environment accessibility – things to read, listen to, or watch – and shared the collection with attendees afterwards. These recommendations came from the speakers, the event team, and our attendees!</p>
<p>Thank you for another great year, see you again in 2021!</p>
