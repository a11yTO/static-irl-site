            <p class="speaker-bio">Chancey Fleet is a Brooklyn-based accessibility advocate. Fleet coordinates technology education programs at the New York Public Library's Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library. Her current library-based projects include group workshops highlighting mobile technologies for independent living and information literacy; programs introducing youth and adults to non-visual techniques for coding and making with Arduino; and the Dimensions project (a recipient of NYPL’s 2016 Innovation Grant for staff projects), which equips community members with the training and tools they need to create accessible tactile maps, diagrams, graphics and objects. Chancey was recognized as a 2017 Library Journal Mover and Shaker. In her Data & Society fellowship work in 2018-2019, Chancey hopes to deepen public understanding and spark widespread curiosity about how cloud-connected accessibility tools enhance or undermine digital equity, autonomy, security, and privacy.</p>

        <section id="Holistic-Design-for-the-Built-Environment" class="talk">
            <h2 class="talk-name">Holistic Design for the Built Environment</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">The permanence and capital cost of the built environment often demand universal solutions that address the needs of all, both now and into the future. Limited by the time and cost of building renovations, it’s important that design solutions serve the greatest number of end users upon implementation. But that doesn’t preclude an inclusive design process that actively engages underserved or underrepresented communities.</p>
            <p>As more design firms take this approach with the built environment, designers are moving beyond building code compliance and discussions about bathrooms—the next step is to take a longer look at how our buildings do not always match the needs of their users. Join us for a conversation of radical inclusion in a quest to make us all universally better designers.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Improving mobility for people living with dementia by examining barriers and supports in land use, urban design and wayfinding in sub/urban neighbourhoods</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">The World Health Organization calls dementia the leading cause of dependency and disability among older adults, and globally, the number of people living with dementia (PLWD) will see a nearly 150% increase from 2015 to 2050. Contrary to popular belief, most PLWD live in the community as opposed to congregate living settings (Alzheimer Society of Canada, 2010). PLWD deserve to age-in-place, however research on built environment facilitators/barriers to independent mobility for this population is nascent. I present research from the Waterloo Region that investigates how PLWD experience elements of their suburban public spaces as enabling/disabling to their independent mobility. Thirteen go-along interviews with seven participants produced a total of 268 images that were collected and analysed into three categories: land-use; urban design; and wayfinding. While this research highlighted barriers for participants, their suburban neighbourhoods were often perceived as enabling in diverse ways, highlighting the need for more nuanced understanding of barriers and facilitators to mobility in suburban settings.</p>
