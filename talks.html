            <h2 class="talk-name">Digital Frictions in Nonvisual Accessibility and the Built Environment</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">When digital amenities like signage, mapping, ticketing and retail kiosks are designed to cater to people who perceive visually, Blind and visually impaired travelers experience heightened, prolonged digital frictions. We'll look at digital amenities that are legible and efficient to nonvisual users, and some that are not. Rather than focusing on the technical means for making digital amenities accessible, we'll explore the impact of digital inhospitality on individual autonomy, confidence and choice.</p>

        <section id="Accessible-maps-and-how-they-create-welcoming-inclusive-places" class="talk">
            <h2 class="talk-name">Accessible maps and how they create welcoming inclusive places</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Maps help define the territories we can explore. In creating accessible spaces and turning them into inclusive places, maps can help many people with differing physical and cognitive capacities. This talk will use an international museum project to talk about the design of accessible maps, both as physical and information artefacts. It will show some ways information is reworked for multi-modal comprehension and how maps can assist people in more ways than simply finding their location. The talk will also discuss how such maps often fail and in what ways we can mitigate some failures. Accessible places need to be welcoming spaces. Maps help provide that good welcome: giving a sense of direction, an idea of what is valuable to visit and of how a person can be confident in the confusing excitement of new places.</p>

        <section id="Fixing-Built-Environment-Design-Education" class="talk">
            <h2 class="talk-name">Fixing Built Environment Design Education</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Over 35 years ago Canada changed our Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and then our Human Rights Codes, to recognize that people with disabilities are equal under the law and that spaces shall not discriminate against them.</p>
            <p>Great, but then something strange happened, or rather didn’t happen: Education for architects, interior designers, landscape architects, lighting consultants, signage designers, and in IT, AV, industrial design and other sectors, did NOT keep up to capture that level of equality for all people of all abilities. We have been and continue to miss out on all that amazing creativity and design problem solving.</p>
            <p>Getting this fixed is clearly long overdue and is one of the key recommendations of the David Onley AODA review report from January 2019. We need to ensure no new graduates leave school having learned the old discriminatory design standards, having maybe only taken one course, or had accessibility taught in passing, or as an afterthought.</p>
            <p>So what’s missing? Where to start? This talk will review what accessibility experts recommend in order to address the most common problems and how the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) is taking a leadership role in developing the first accessible design course for both their students and as part of the continuing education for their membership.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Accessible Design in Japan</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">Tokyo will be hosting the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic games in 2020 and Japan is seeing improved accessibility in anticipation.</p>
            <p>There are existing national standards on the theme of “Accessible Design” in Japan, but it has been recommended to make buildings, facilities, transportation, and daily necessities easier to use for older people and people with disabilities.</p>
            <p>Makoto will outline Japan’s national accessibility standards, what recommendations are being made for improvements, and introduce various examples of Japanese “Accessible Design”.</p>

        <section id="Holistic-Design-for-the-Built-Environment" class="talk">
            <h2 class="talk-name">Holistic Design for the Built Environment</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">The permanence and capital cost of the built environment often demand universal solutions that address the needs of all, both now and into the future. Limited by the time and cost of building renovations, it’s important that design solutions serve the greatest number of end users upon implementation. But that doesn’t preclude an inclusive design process that actively engages underserved or underrepresented communities.</p>
            <p>As more design firms take this approach with the built environment, designers are moving beyond building code compliance and discussions about bathrooms—the next step is to take a longer look at how our buildings do not always match the needs of their users. Join us for a conversation of radical inclusion in a quest to make us all universally better designers.</p>

            <p class="talk-desc">The dwarfism community, much like any community of people, is incredibly diverse and one of the most recognized and still ostracized groups. This talk will begin by outlining what it is to be a little person, and what its like navigating the world both physically and mentally. Having an education in Interior Design, I will also talk about how I use and feel in spaces, comparing living in Winnipeg vs Toronto, and how traditional accessible design can sometimes miss the mark for actually including everyone.</p>

            <h2 class="talk-name">Improving mobility for people living with dementia by examining barriers and supports in land use, urban design and wayfinding in sub/urban neighbourhoods</h2>
            <p class="talk-desc">The World Health Organization calls dementia the leading cause of dependency and disability among older adults, and globally, the number of people living with dementia (PLWD) will see a nearly 150% increase from 2015 to 2050. Contrary to popular belief, most PLWD live in the community as opposed to congregate living settings (Alzheimer Society of Canada, 2010). PLWD deserve to age-in-place, however research on built environment facilitators/barriers to independent mobility for this population is nascent. I present research from the Waterloo Region that investigates how PLWD experience elements of their suburban public spaces as enabling/disabling to their independent mobility. Thirteen go-along interviews with seven participants produced a total of 268 images that were collected and analysed into three categories: land-use; urban design; and wayfinding. While this research highlighted barriers for participants, their suburban neighbourhoods were often perceived as enabling in diverse ways, highlighting the need for more nuanced understanding of barriers and facilitators to mobility in suburban settings.</p>

            <p class="talk-desc">Hard of hearing and Deaf members of the community face a variety of barriers – some expected and some not – that impact one’s comfort, health, and safety. This talk will explore issues with the built environment, identifying both common barriers and not very obvious barriers such as things that interfere with the working order of hearing aids, public address systems (e.g., transit announcements, fire warden announcements, etc.) that provide no clear alternatives to the auditory message, restaurants with no quiet zones, and other similar real life challenges. The talk will include some discussion of how built environments could mitigate or even resolve some of these issues.</p>
